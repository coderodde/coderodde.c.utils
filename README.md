# coderodde.c.utils

The main aim of this project is to provide implementations of most fundamental data structures and algorithms.

### TODO:
- [x] `map` (a ordered map using a AVL-tree)
- [x] `set` (a ordered set using a AVL-tree)
- [x] `unordered_map` (a unordered map using a hash table)
- [x] `unordered_set` (a unordered set using a hash table)
- [x] `heap` (a `d`-ary heap)
- [x] `fibonacci_heap`
- [x] `list` (an array based list supporting fast insertion/removal from both ends)

### POSSIBLY:
- [x] `stable_sort` (a natural merge sort)
- [ ] `parallel_stable_sort` (a parallel natural merge sort) - provided that the future versions of C library include portable thread facilities.
- [ ] `integer_sort` (a radix sort)
- [ ] `parallel_integer_sort` (a parallel radix sort) - provided that the future versions of C library include portable thread facilities.
